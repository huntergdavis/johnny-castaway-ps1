## 1. Sound Inventory

### 1.1 Source Format

All 23 original WAV files share identical format:
- **Sample rate:** 11025 Hz
- **Bit depth:** 8-bit unsigned
- **Channels:** 1 (mono)
- **Container:** RIFF WAV

Note: `convert-sounds.sh` comment says "22050 Hz" but this is incorrect. Every
WAV file is 11025 Hz as verified by parsing headers.

**(C)** = Called from C code (`story.c`), not TTM scripts. Sound 0 plays at
every daytime scene start via `soundPlay(0)` in `story.c:448` and `story.c:503`.

### 1.3 Key Observations

- **23 WAV files exist** on disk (indices 0-10, 12, 14-24; gaps at 11 and 13).
- **22 sounds are actually triggered** by the game (21 via TTM + sound 0 via C code).
- **Sound 11**: Referenced once in GJCATCH2.TTM but no WAV file exists. The
  desktop build silently ignores this (prints debug warning). PS1 should do same.
- **Sound 17**: WAV exists but is never referenced by any TTM or C code. Can be
  excluded from the PS1 build entirely.
- **Sound 0**: Only triggered from `story.c` (not TTMs). Plays at every
  daytime scene start, making it moderately frequent in practice.
- **Most frequently referenced**: Sound 16 (78 refs), Sound 6 (67 refs),
  Sound 9 (49 refs), Sound 5 (45 refs).
- **All sounds are short effects** -- longest is 1.83s (sound 10). No looping
  sounds, no music.

## 2. Current PS1 Implementation Status

The existing `sound_ps1.c` already implements a working basic audio system:

- Calls `SpuInit()` and sets master volume.
- Loads all 25 VAG files from CD at startup (`\\SND\\SOUND00.VAG;1` etc.).
- Uploads each VAG's ADPCM data to SPU RAM sequentially starting at 0x1010.
- Uses round-robin across 8 SPU channels for playback.
- Parses VAG header for sample rate, computes SPU pitch via `getSPUSampleRate()`.
- ADSR set to max attack, max sustain, no release (0x7F/0x0/0x7F/0x0/0xF).

The existing VAG files in `jc_resources/extracted/snd/` were generated by the
custom `scripts/wav2vag.py` encoder.

## 3. SPU RAM Budget

### 3.1 SPU RAM Layout

```
0x0000 - 0x0FFF  [4,096 B]  Reserved (capture buffers)
0x1000 - 0x100F  [   16 B]  PSn00bSDK dummy sample block
0x1010 - onwards              Sound effect ADPCM data
                  ...
0x7FFFF                       End of 512 KB SPU RAM
```

Usable space for sound data: **520,176 bytes** (0x1010 to 0x7FFFF).

### 3.2 Current ADPCM Sizes (from existing VAG files)

| Idx | ADPCM Bytes | Notes               |
|----:|------------:|:---------------------|
|   0 |       5,904 |                      |
|   1 |       6,368 |                      |

|  24 |       5,568 |                      |
| **Total** | **96,656** | **94.4 KB** |

**Current SPU RAM usage: 18.6%** of usable space. This is very comfortable.

### 3.3 After Optimizations

| Optimization               | Total ADPCM | Savings     |
|:---------------------------|------------:|------------:|
| Current (as-is)            |  96,656 B   |         --- |
| Remove unused sound 17     |  94,192 B   |   2,464 B   |
| Trim silence (all sounds)  |  79,360 B   |  14,832 B   |
| **Remove 17 + trim all**   |  **77,072 B** | **19,584 B** |

Trimmed + pruned total: **75.3 KB** (14.8% of SPU RAM).

### 3.4 Verdict: Sample Rate Reduction Not Needed

The source WAVs are already at 11025 Hz, which is the lowest practical rate for
these sound effects. Downsampling to 5512 Hz would save ~50% but produce
unacceptably muffled audio for effects that contain transients (clicks, splashes,
impacts). Since total usage is only ~95 KB out of ~508 KB available, there is no
reason to reduce sample rate.

Similarly, mono downmixing is not applicable since all sources are already mono.

## 4. Loading Strategy: Full Preload at Startup

### 4.1 Recommendation: Preload All Sounds

**Justification:**
- Total ADPCM data is only ~95 KB, fitting easily in the ~508 KB of usable SPU RAM.
- All 22 active sounds can be loaded simultaneously with 413 KB to spare.
- Preloading eliminates CD seek latency during gameplay (CD seeks are 100-300ms).
- No system RAM is consumed -- data goes directly from CD to main RAM buffer to
  SPU RAM, then the main RAM buffer is freed.
- The existing `sound_ps1.c` already implements this approach correctly.

**Why not on-demand loading:**
- CD access during scene playback would cause visible frame hitches.
- The CD drive is already used for loading scene BMP/TTM/SCR data.
- Contention between sound loading and scene data loading would be complex.
- There is no memory pressure to justify the complexity.

**Why not streaming:**
- All sounds are under 2 seconds. Streaming is for long audio (music, voice).
- Streaming requires dedicated SPU channels, IRQ handlers, and double-buffering
  logic. Massive overkill for short one-shot effects.

### 4.2 Main RAM Impact During Loading

During `soundInit()`, each VAG file is loaded from CD into a temporary main RAM
buffer, then DMA'd to SPU RAM, then freed. The largest single VAG file is
SOUND10.VAG at 11,648 bytes. Peak transient main RAM usage is ~12 KB (one
file at a time). This is negligible.

After all uploads complete, zero main RAM is consumed by audio. The
`soundAddresses[]`, `soundSizes[]`, and `soundSampleRates[]` arrays total only
25 x 12 = 300 bytes of static data.

## 5. Conversion Pipeline

### 5.1 Current Pipeline

```
sound{N}.wav  -->  scripts/wav2vag.py  -->  jc_resources/extracted/snd/SOUND{NN}.VAG
```

The existing `wav2vag.py` script:
1. Reads WAV header to get sample rate, channels, bit depth.
2. Converts 8-bit unsigned to 16-bit signed PCM.
3. Encodes to PS1 SPU ADPCM (4-bit, 28 samples per 16-byte block).
4. Uses brute-force best-fit across 5 filter coefficients x 13 shift values.
5. Prepends 48-byte VAG header (magic "VAGp", version 0x20, big-endian sizes).
6. Adds leading silent block (16 bytes) and trailing end block (flag 0x07).

### 5.2 Recommended Enhanced Pipeline

```
sound{N}.wav
    |
    v
[1] Trim silence (leading + trailing, threshold = 5 from center)
    |
    v
[2] Skip sound 17 (unused) and sound 11/13 (no WAV)
    |
    v
[3] Encode to ADPCM (existing wav2vag.py encoder)
    |
    v
[4] Write VAG with header
    |
    v
SOUND{NN}.VAG --> placed in CD image under \SND\
```

### 5.3 Implementation Details

**Silence trimming** should be added to `wav2vag.py`. Trim to the nearest ADPCM
block boundary (28 samples) to avoid cutting mid-block. Trim thresholds per the
analysis:

| Idx | Leading Silence | Trailing Silence | Total Trimmable | % of File |
|----:|----------------:|-----------------:|----------------:|----------:|
|   0 |              99 |            2,772 |           2,871 |     28.0% |
|   1 |              89 |            1,115 |           1,204 |     10.9% |
|   5 |             205 |              677 |             882 |     31.3% |
|   9 |             549 |              315 |             864 |     28.4% |
|  10 |             340 |            2,938 |           3,278 |     16.2% |
|  16 |             984 |            1,302 |           2,286 |     30.1% |
|  21 |             174 |            1,696 |           1,870 |     38.7% |
|  24 |             988 |            3,202 |           4,190 |     43.3% |

Sounds 0, 5, 9, 16, 21, and 24 benefit most from trimming (>28% reduction).

**Sound 17 exclusion**: Simply skip it in the conversion script. The
`soundPlay()` function already handles missing sounds gracefully (returns
immediately if `soundAddresses[nb] == 0`).

### 5.4 No External Tool Dependencies

The project already has a pure-Python VAG encoder (`scripts/wav2vag.py`) that
produces correct output. No need for external `wav2vag` binaries, `ffmpeg`, or
PSn00bSDK tools (PSn00bSDK 0.24 does not include a VAG encoder).

## 6. SPU RAM Address Map

### 6.1 Proposed Layout (All Sounds Preloaded, With Trimming)

All addresses are 16-byte aligned (ADPCM block size). Sounds are packed
sequentially starting at 0x1010.

```
Address     Size    Sound   Duration  Description
-------     ----    -----   --------  -----------
0x00000     4096    ---     ---       Reserved (SPU capture buffers)

0x146C0     FREE    ---     ---       Remaining 430 KB free

Total sounds in SPU RAM: 22 (excluding snd11, snd13, snd17)
Total ADPCM:             79,536 B (77.7 KB)
Free SPU RAM:            440,640 B (430.3 KB, available for future music/reverb)
```

Note: Sound 18 is only used in SJMSUZY.TTM (3 references). It could optionally
be loaded on-demand to save 7.7 KB, but this is unnecessary given available space.

### 6.2 16-Byte Alignment

The existing code already aligns addresses:
```c
spuAddr += (adpcmSize + 15) & ~15;
```

The PSn00bSDK example rounds to 64-byte boundaries for DMA efficiency:
```c
int _size = (size + 63) & 0xffffffc0;
```

Recommendation: Use 64-byte alignment for DMA transfer reliability, 16-byte
alignment for address tracking. The existing code should be updated:

```c
/* DMA transfers should be padded to 64-byte boundaries */
SpuWrite((uint32_t *)(vagData + VAG_HEADER_SIZE), (adpcmSize + 63) & ~63);

/* But SPU address tracking can use 16-byte alignment */
spuAddr += (adpcmSize + 15) & ~15;
```

## 7. Implementation Changes Required

### 7.1 Changes to sound_ps1.c

The existing implementation is already functional. Required changes are minimal:

1. **Fix DMA transfer size alignment**: Round `SpuWrite()` size to 64-byte
   boundary (matching PSn00bSDK examples).

2. **Fix ADSR parameters**: Current values `(0x7F, 0x0, 0x7F, 0x0, 0xF)` use
   the `SpuSetVoiceADSR` macro which maps to specific register fields. A better
   configuration for one-shot effects that disable the envelope entirely:
   ```c
   SPU_CH_ADSR1(ch) = 0x00FF;  /* Max attack, no decay */
   SPU_CH_ADSR2(ch) = 0x0000;  /* No sustain/release rate */
   ```
   This matches the PSn00bSDK `vagsample` example exactly.

3. **Stop channel before reuse**: Add `SpuSetKey(0, 1 << ch)` before setting
   new parameters, to avoid glitches when a channel is reused while still
   playing:
   ```c
   SpuSetKey(0, 1 << ch);
   SPU_CH_FREQ(ch)  = getSPUSampleRate(soundSampleRates[nb]);
   SPU_CH_ADDR(ch)  = getSPUAddr(soundAddresses[nb]);
   SPU_CH_VOL_L(ch) = 0x3FFF;
   SPU_CH_VOL_R(ch) = 0x3FFF;
   SPU_CH_ADSR1(ch) = 0x00FF;
   SPU_CH_ADSR2(ch) = 0x0000;
   SpuSetKey(1, 1 << ch);
   ```

4. **Consider reducing channel count**: 8 round-robin channels is generous. The
   game rarely plays more than 2-3 overlapping sounds. 4 channels would suffice
   and leave more channels free for potential future music playback.

### 7.2 Changes to wav2vag.py

Add silence trimming:

```python
def trim_silence(samples, threshold=5*256, block_size=28):
    """Trim leading and trailing silence, aligned to ADPCM block boundaries."""
    # Find first non-silent sample
    first = 0
    for i, s in enumerate(samples):
        if abs(s) > threshold:
            first = i
            break
    # Align to block boundary (round down)
    first = (first // block_size) * block_size

    # Find last non-silent sample
    last = len(samples) - 1
    for i in range(len(samples) - 1, -1, -1):
        if abs(samples[i]) > threshold:
            last = i
            break
    # Align to block boundary (round up)
    last = ((last + block_size) // block_size) * block_size

    return samples[first:last]
```

### 7.3 Changes to cd_layout.xml

Remove SOUND17.VAG entry if excluding unused sound:
```xml
<!-- Remove this line: -->
<file name="SOUND17.VAG" type="data" source="..."/>
```

### 7.4 Changes to convert-sounds.sh

Add skip for sound 17:
```bash
if [ $i -eq 17 ]; then
    echo "  SKIP: sound17.wav (unused by game)"
    continue
fi
```

## 8. Memory Savings Summary

| Configuration                    | SPU RAM Used | % of Usable | Savings vs Current |
|:---------------------------------|-------------:|------------:|-------------------:|
| Current (all 23 VAGs, no trim)   |    96,656 B  |       18.6% |                --- |
| Drop sound 17 only               |    94,192 B  |       18.1% |          2,464 B   |
| Trim silence only (keep all)     |    81,824 B  |       15.7% |         14,832 B   |
| **Drop 17 + trim silence**       | **79,536 B** |   **15.3%** |     **17,120 B**   |

Those rows describe the SFX bank alone. The current shipped audio path also
loads `OCEAN.VAG` after the SFX bank when ambience is enabled. With the current
assets and the loader's 64-byte DMA alignment, measured residency is:

| State | Used from SPU start | Free in 512 KB SPU RAM |
|:------|--------------------:|-----------------------:|
| SFX loaded, before `OCEAN.VAG` | 101,392 B | 422,896 B |
| SFX plus `OCEAN.VAG` loaded | 227,408 B | 296,880 B |

The primary value of SFX trimming is still improved responsiveness through
silence removal. The remaining SPU headroom is large enough to consider as
experimental async-loading cold storage, but it is not CPU-addressable heap:
data must be DMA-written to SPU RAM and DMA-read back before CPU decode or GPU
upload.

Each ADPCM block (16 bytes):
- Byte 0: `(shift & 0xF) | (filter << 4)`
- Byte 1: Flags (0=normal, 1=loop end, 3=loop start, 7=stop)
- Bytes 2-15: 28 nibbles of 4-bit ADPCM delta samples

## 10. Future Considerations

### 10.1 Music Support

With ~430 KB of SPU RAM free after loading all sound effects, there is ample
room for background music if desired. Options:

- **SPU streaming from CD**: Use PSn00bSDK's streaming example pattern.
  Double-buffer ~16 KB in SPU RAM, stream from CD. Requires 2 channels for
  stereo. The `cdstream` example provides a complete reference implementation.
- **XA audio**: PS1's native CD-XA interleaved audio. Higher quality than SPU
  ADPCM at similar bitrates. Requires authoring XA sectors on the CD.

### 10.2 Reverb

The PS1 SPU has built-in reverb effects. With abundant free SPU RAM, a small
reverb buffer could add atmospheric depth. The reverb work RAM would need to be
allocated at the end of SPU RAM (SPU hardware requirement). Even a basic "room"
preset uses only ~32 KB.

### 10.3 Sound Priority System

If future scenes require many simultaneous sounds, a priority system could
replace round-robin channel allocation. Assign priorities based on sound type
(high-frequency transients > ambient) and preempt lowest-priority channels.
Not needed currently since max concurrent sounds in any scene is 2-3.

### 10.4 Volume Scaling

The original screensaver likely had volume variation per sound. The ADS/TTM
scripts might encode volume parameters that are currently ignored. The
`PLAY_SAMPLE` opcode (0xC051) takes a single argument (sound index) with no
volume parameter, so per-sound volume would need to be hardcoded or derived from
context. The SPU channel volume registers (`SPU_CH_VOL_L/R`) support 15-bit
signed values (0x0000-0x3FFF), so fine-grained volume control is trivially
possible.
